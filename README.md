# AllMorse

Recently I got a book that had some morse code on the cover of it. Or at least it's a series of dots and dashes.

AllMorse was the easiest way for me to decode it to all possible morse code combinations and see if there was a hidden message. (Yes I know morse code, yes, this is still easier than a pen and paper.)
